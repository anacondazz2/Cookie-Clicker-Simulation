# Cookie-Clicker-Simulation
A cookie clicker simulation made in Greenfoot for ICS4U. Two sides fight to go to the moon!

## How to Run
1. Download [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/download).

2. Download the .gfar file and try to open it.
This may also download a "lost-dino" folder that contains all the files for the game. If opening the .gfar file fails, delete the .gfar file and open "project.greenfoot" inside this folder. 

Enjoy playing!
